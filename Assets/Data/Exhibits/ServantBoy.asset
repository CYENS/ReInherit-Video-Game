  label: Altar Boy
  description: "He wears a short-sleeved garment, the lower border of which is schematically
    rolled up to uncover the genitals and both legs below the knees. The garment
    is grooved vertically. The right arm is stretched downwards and holds a loop-shaped
    object in the right hand, which may probably be a special sort of bread (koullouri).
    Nothing in left hand. Such objects are held by male and female terracotta figurines
    found in the favissa at Kamelarga, Kition. We identified these as special bread,
    koullouri offered perhaps on special religious festivals, as today with the koullouri
    made for Easter and Christmas. Bracelets round both wrists and anklets. A string
    round the neck with a horizontal \u2018toggle\u2019 pendant, from which hangs
    a vertically grooved rectangular pendant. Flat back. Round face, large almond-shaped
    eyes with ridged eyelids, disc-shaped ear-ring at lobe. Fringe of hair above
    forehead. Red paint for plinth, lips, ear-rings, rectangular pendant and neck
    border of garment. The pendants worn by the temple-boy are of interest. The \u2018toggle\u2019
    pendant is quite common on temple-boys and has been referred to as a spindle.
    It was identified as a pendant, based on ivory objects of a similar shape found
    at Salamis which are certainly \u2018toggles\u2019 for suspension by fastening."
