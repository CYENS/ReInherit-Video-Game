  label: Turkish brazier, Constantinople type
  description: 'This object was used as a brazier and consists of 3 parts, a base,
    an inner container and a lid. The base rests on 6 feet with decoration all around.
    On top there is a free-standing copper container, in which the fuel was placed,
    with two cast bronze handles for easy removal. The brazier was sealed with a
    domed copper lid, on the top of which there is a bronze star with the crescent
    moon. The star served both as a handle for the lid and as a decorative element
    that indicated the Turkish origin of the brazier. Similar types of braziers are
    available with several variations in their decoration, indicative of the importance
    given to this object by craftsmen in their effort to satisfy their wealthy customers.
    Copper braziers of this type were used in urban houses in Cyprus as a necessary
    item-furniture during the period of Ottoman rule. '
