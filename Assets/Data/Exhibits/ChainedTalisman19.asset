  label: "\u2018Ambousta\u2019 (case) round silver case"
  description: 'A small round silver case, also known as an ''abusta'', with a chain,
    which was used as a pendant in the 19th century. This particular jewel was used
    as a talisman, which can be seen from its decoration. In addition to the floral
    decoration with the central eight-petalled flower on the front, the reverse has
    an engraved six-pointed star, while the second chain ends in a hook with an engraved
    female figure. The use of both the six-pointed star and the human face was very
    common in folk art as symbols to ward off evil. '
