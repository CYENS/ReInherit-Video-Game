  label: 'Clay vase '
  description: 'Clay vase with a high neck and wide opening. The vessel also had
    a vertical handle which is not preserved. Its decoration includes subjects related
    to marine life in black on a ceramic surface. Both the shape and the decoration
    are an imitation of a well-known vase of the Minoan era (15th century BC), which
    is known as the "Marseille vase" and is one of the most impressive examples of
    maritime style from the Minoan era. The vase was made in the "Leon" pottery workshop
    founded by Yiannis Iliadis in Kyrenia. Such imitations of vase records did not
    faithfully follow either the shape or the decoration of the ancient vases, since
    the potter was merely inspired by them but did not copy them. The vase is stamped
    on the base with the lion emblem and the words LION, CYPRUS and POTTERY. '
