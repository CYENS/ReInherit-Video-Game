  label: Carved wooden church chair
  description: "This particular chair belongs to a special group of handmade seats
    with carved wood decoration. This type of carved chairs was not common in traditional
    Cypriot houses but rather rare. Indicative of their rarity is the fact that the
    carved chairs used by the newlyweds on their wedding day, in many villages, were
    usually given as a loan by the church or the community. This particular chair
    has decoration all over the back and front legs, which is dominated by criss-crossed
    lines along with incised circles. It also features an embossed cross within a
    circle on the upper back. The back is also decorated with four \"pillars\" which
    resemble the \u2018parmakia\u2019, a characteristic of the windows of folk architecture. "
