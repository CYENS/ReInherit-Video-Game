  label: "Vase with \u201Ckannourka\u201D, red clay pottery"
  description: 'This vase is representative of rural pottery centres, such as Phoini,
    where female potters made such vases on the wheel ("gyristari"). The vase is
    made of red clay and is hand-carved with decoration of flowers and birds. The
    decorative elements are attached to the main body of the vase, with cylindrical
    stems called "kannourka", on which birds and flowers can be seen alternately.
    The vase is particularly elaborate as it consists of 2 vases, with the smaller
    one at the top, at the mouth of which there are 2 birds facing each other. The
    vase is engraved with the inscription PHINI CYPRUS SOFRONIA in English (that
    is the name of the manufacturing village and of the potter), since it was intended
    for the tourist market of the time. '
