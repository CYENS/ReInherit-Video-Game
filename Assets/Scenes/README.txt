We've split the various scenes into different folders to better organize our project.
Here is what each folder is supposed to be for:
- Testing: Contains development rooms and isolated test scenes.
- Game: The scenes that will be used for demos, builds, and the final game
- Tools: Isolated scenes for developing and/or testing tools/technologies
- Effects: Isolated scenes for testing and developing visual effects (e.x Outline shaders)
